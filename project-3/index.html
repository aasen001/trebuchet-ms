  <h2 class="about" id="abt">About</h2>

  <p class="aboutparagraph1"><br>Trebuchet MS is a humanist sans-serif typeface that
    Vincent Connare designed
  for Microsoft Corporation in 1996. Trebuchet MS was the font used for the
  window titles in the Windows XP default theme, succeeding MS Sans Serif and
  Tahoma. Released free of charge by Microsoft as part of their core fonts for
  the Web package, it remained one of the most popular body text fonts on
  webpages as of 2009.</br>

  <br>Trebuchet MS is named after the trebuchet, a medieval siege engine. The name
  was inspired by a puzzle question that Connare heard at Microsoft
  headquarters: "Can you make a trebuchet that could launch a person from main
  campus to the new consumer campus about a mile away? Mathematically, is it
  possible and how?" Connare "thought that would be a great name for a font
  that launches words across the Internet.”</br>

  <br><p class="bodycopyparagraph">Windows XP is a major release of Microsoft's
    Windows NT operating system. It was released to manufacturing on August 24,
    2001, and later to retail on October 25, 2001. It is a direct upgrade to
    its predecessors, Windows 2000 for high-end and business users and Windows
    Me for home users, available for any devices running Windows NT 4.0, Windows
    98, Windows 2000 and Windows Me that meet the new Windows XP system
    requirements.</br>

  <br><i>Development of Windows XP began in the late 1990s under the codename
    "Neptune", built on the Windows NT kernel explicitly intended for mainstream
    consumer use. An updated version of Windows 2000 was also initially planned
    for the business market. However, in January 2000, both projects were
    scrapped in favor of a single OS codenamed "Whistler", which would serve
    as a single platform for both consumer and business markets. As a result,
    Windows XP is the first consumer edition of Windows not based on the Windows
    95 kernel and MS-DOS. Windows XP removed support for PC-98, i486 and SGI
    Visual Workstation 320 and 540 and will only run on 32-bit x86 CPUs and
    devices which use BIOS firmware.
Upon its release, Windows XP received critical acclaim, noting increased
performance and stability (especially compared to Windows Me), a more
intuitive user interface, improved hardware support, and expanded multimedia
capabilities. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 were succeeded by Windows
Vista and Windows Server 2008, released in 2007 and 2008, respectively.</i></br>

  <br><b>Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009, and extended
    support ended on April 8, 2014. After that, the operating system ceased
    receiving further support. Windows Embedded POSReady 2009, based on Windows
    XP Professional, received security updates until April 2019. After that,
    unofficial methods were made available to apply the updates to other editions
    of Windows XP. Still, Microsoft discouraged this practice, citing
    incompatibility issues. However, over three years from the end of all
    Microsoft support, the majority of PCs in some countries such as Armenia
    still appear to be running on Windows XP. As of September 2022, globally,
    just 0.39% of Windows PCs and 0.1% of all devices across all platforms
    continue to run Windows XP.</p></br>
